The game is Blackjack, also known as 21.
Each card worth its value, while Prince, Queen and King are worth 10
Aces are special, as they will worth either 11 or 1, depends on what value is better for you
The goal is to get the sum of cards to 21, or as close as possible.
If you accidentally exceed 21, you lose your bet.
If you managed to hit a Blackjack, which means get 10 + Ace, you'll be rewarded extra coins
You can side bet on Insurance in case the dealer's up card is Ace.
You can split your hand if you have enough money and both of your first 2 cards has same value
Losing means losing the sum you bet. Tie doesn't lose or gain money.
Good luck!
